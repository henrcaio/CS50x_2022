# CS50x 2022 - Introduction To Computer Science
Harvard's CS50x 2022 - Labs and Psets

> This repo was built to display my solutions to Harvard's <a href='https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/'>CS50x</a>. You'll be redirected either to <b>my solutions</b> by clicking on the name of the project or the <b>CS50's implementation details and instructions</b> by clicking on <i>Lab</i> or <i>Pset Instructions</i>.

#### Every lab and pset achieved 100% when submitted.
###### I'll be pleased to answer any questions you may have, so if you do have one <i>hit me up!</i>
